While double or triple glazing can be a big help if you have something like an airport or main road nearby, don't forget that earplugs may be far more effective – especially if the noise is only temporary.",

Carpets are better than wooden floors but rugs will work a treat too. Curtains are good at absorbing sound but make sure they're dense and heavy, reaching right down to the floor.",
